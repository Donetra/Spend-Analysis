# Spend-Analysis
Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of supply chain spending data, integrating diverse supplier and contractor information. The primary aim was to provide insights for strategic decision-making and identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that could guide the selection of new services. This project utilized several powerful tools, including Excel, Power Query, SQL, and Power BI.
Technologies Used

Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization. Excel was crucial in conducting preliminary data analysis, organizing raw datasets, and preparing the data for further processing.
Power Query: Played a vital role in transforming data, including merging multiple data sources and automating various data transformation tasks. Power Query enabled efficient data cleansing, shaping, and integration, improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the dataset.
SQL: Used for querying and extracting relevant information from the databases, allowing deep analysis of the supply chain's financial data. SQL helped to perform complex calculations, joins, and generate insightful KPIs for supply chain optimization.
Power BI: Leveraged to create comprehensive visual reports and dashboards that transformed raw data into actionable insights. Power BI allowed stakeholders to interact with the data, understand trends, and support strategic planning decisions.
Project Objectives

Conduct an integrated analysis of supplier and contractor data to derive strategic insights.
Identify and generate KPIs for new services to enhance supply chain efficiency.
Provide stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of spending patterns through interactive visualizations.
Project Features

Data Integration: Combined various supplier and contractor datasets into a cohesive structure for better insights.
Data Analysis: Used SQL to perform detailed analysis of the financial data, including trend analysis and KPI generation.
Automation: Power Query automated many repetitive data transformation tasks, improving data quality and saving time.
Visual Reporting: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI that presented key metrics and findings, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
Results

Improved data accuracy through enhanced data integration processes.
Automated data transformation saved approximately 30% of manual effort in preparing the final dataset.
Visual dashboards empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions more effectively.
Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the application of Excel, Power Query, SQL, and Power BI in analyzing supply chain data. The combination of these tools helped deliver an end-to-end solution for analyzing spending patterns, generating insights, and aiding strategic decision-making.
